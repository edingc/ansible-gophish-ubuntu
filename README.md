<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

As this is an Ansible playbook, Ansible is required to be installed on a control
machine. [Ansible is available for almost every platform.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

This playbook was developed using a Digital Ocean Ubuntu 18.04 instance, but should
work on any Ubuntu 18.04 installation.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/edingc/ansible-gophish-ubuntu.git
```
2. Run the Ansible playbook
```sh
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After the playbook has been run against the target host, a file containing needed
DNS entries will be placed in the home directory of Gophish user. Place these
entries into your DNS.

The use guide for Gophish can be found at the [Gophish documentation website](https://getgophish.com/documentation/).
